Note Taker is a server run application that allows the user to take notes and save them to a database which the user can reload at any given time. Each individual note has a different and unique number ID and there can be a total of at least 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 different notes saved. Granted that the users computer can handle that. Even if the user has created 2 notes with the same content and title they will both have a unique ID linked to them so the user can delete the exact note they want to.
